"""Mis-mark guard for ``@pytest.mark.performance`` tests (#3665, FR-020).

The nightly full-mode lane (``ci-nightly.yml``, mission
``ci-pipeline-reinstatement-01M1X35E`` WP13/T6) moves performance / heavy-e2e /
interpreter-matrix jobs off the per-PR blocking path onto a nightly + manual-
dispatch cadence (#3595). That move only stays honest if a test can never be
mis-marked ``@pytest.mark.performance`` to *dodge* the PR gate while still
carrying functional coverage: a performance-marked test may assert wall-clock
/ timing-budget facts only (:data:`TIMING_ASSERTION_VOCABULARY`); any other
assertion in its body is functional coverage smuggled onto the nightly-only
cadence, off the per-PR path — a mis-mark this guard flags.

:func:`find_functional_assertions_under_performance_marker` is the pure,
collection-free guard: it takes Python **source text** (never a real,
permanently-collected test) so the planted mis-marked/correctly-marked
fixtures below never become carriers any other marker-completeness gate has
to route (``test_marker_job_completeness.py`` /
``test_fast_tier_marker_completeness.py`` stay untouched by this file).

SC-011 (a per-PR run executes 0 performance/heavy-e2e/interpreter jobs) is
asserted the same way: statically, over the on-disk workflow YAML, never by
actually dispatching a run.
